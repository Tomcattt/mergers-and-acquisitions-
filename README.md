# Tech M&A prediction with patent data

The aim of the project is to set up a system to predict the possibility of a merger or acquisition of a tech startup. Based on the similarity of a startup's patents with the patents of other companies, one could predict whether or not this startup is an interesting target for other companies.

The results of this study are interesting for VC funds. This allows them to drastically reduce their potential targets, to focus on tech companies with a high  probability of being bought out in a M&A process, thus allowing VC funds to gain more premium and lose less time in the choice of their target.
